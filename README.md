## Hi there 👋
instagram
To create the badge the syntax is:



![<Badge Name>](https://img.shields.io/badge/<Badge Text>-<Background Color>?style=for-the-badge&logo=<Icon Name>&logoColor=<Logo Color>)


So the Github badge would look like:



![github](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=GitHub&logoColor=white)]


You can browse through the list of available icons on Simple Icons

2. Manage your Repositories
Github allows you to pin Repositories and Gists in your profile. This is a remarkable feature that enables you to display the things you want to showcase.

Pinned repositories

It's also a good idea to add details, tags and emojis to make the repository more engaging.

Repository with details
Repository with no details

As you can see, the one with details is way more engaging than the one without any.

3. Contribute, Contribute and Contribute some more!
This is simply the most important step to make your GitHub look awesome! I get it, getting started is scary, so if you need help, check out this article on how to get started with Open Source Development. You don't have to start with huge features or projects; begin with documentation fixes, then move on to tiny bug fixes and features.

Open Source Development can boost your profile regardless if you are going for a job interview or freelancing. After a few good contributions, you will start getting job offers from various companies.

Open Source Contributions

One essential thing to keep in mind is: DO NOT TRY TO CHEAT THE PROCESS. Every one of your contributions is listed on GitHub. There are a lot of people who create fake issues to get a green dot for contribution. This only creates negative impression on the person viewing your profile. If you keep making tiny incremental improvements, you will make it; if you try to use a shortcut, you will likely crash and burn. As the saying goes, "Slow and steady wins the race."

My takeaway from your third paragraph is that this GitHub graph is stupid and toxic, I wish they remove it. It's perfectly fine to take vacations and take a complete break from programming. It is fine to use GitLab for a while and have nothing to show on the graph. It is fine to be sick and take some rest

😅 I appreciate your thoughts.

I meant "don't make fake contributions". It's highly NOT advisable to keep working till you burn out

Nice readme btw :)

Your readme is quite nice. There is1 issue though, the link icons you are using are black, it's hard to see them in the dark mode
